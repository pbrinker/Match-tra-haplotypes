## The goal of this project was to create a tool to determine haplotypes in the sex-determination gen tra.
We created out of existing sequences a haplotype dictionary in which new sequences can be scored for a match with existing haplotypes.

##Structure of the project

For creating of the Haplotype-dictionary we have three folders, following the steps:

1. Preparation of the sequences
2. Determination of haplotypes
3. Creating a dictionary

If you are working on an other computer, or in an different order you have to change the path accordingly, or remove the command. 

Please read ‘README’ files in the directories for further informations
