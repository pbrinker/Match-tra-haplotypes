##Use Dictionary to find if haplotype from tra is scored
Compare tra-sequence with the stored ones in dictionary

The idea is you search for your sequence and you get a hit if it is already scored in the dictionary

There are two possibilites to do this

1. Good_sequence
A good sequence is already alignet and cropped, fitting to the provided sequences

In this case you can go to Good_sequences and use the script to create a dictionary, give your sequence as input and see if you have a match

2. Bad_sequence

You have to follow Step1 and align and trim your sequence and transform it

Go to folder Step1 or use a tool of your choise and align and trim your sequence

After this you can use the script to create a dictionary, give your sequence as input and see if you have a match
