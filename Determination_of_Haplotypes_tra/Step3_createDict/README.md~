#Creating Haplotype dictionary



##Goal:
Based on the outputfile (name) from Step 2.2 where we determine haplotypes by grouping samples with the same sequence together, we will create a haplotype dictionary. This dictionary can be used for searching with a new sequence for a match

#Preparation of the input file
Here we want to create a file where we have columns separated by space
1. Make a copy of the original output file and name it new, e.g. Haplodict
2. Open the output file in jedit, or text editor of your choice, observe the file, notice that sample ID's are separated by comma. 
   2.1 Search for comma’s and replace them by semicolon
3. Bring the sample ID's and sequence in one column and separate with an comma.
4. Put sequence in the beginning, as it will be the key in our dictionary. Add after it a new column with Haplotype + a continues number. 

Close the file and now you can use it for creating a Haplotype dictionary  with the python script "createhaplodict.py"
